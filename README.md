# Gacha Suggest Moves
The goal of this project is to create a program that will view battles in real-time and make suggestions for what move to make based on the stats of the characters in each party.

I will not consider some of the more niche special mechanics/moves such as True Kikyo Kushida's Charm/Unmask, False Ayanokoji's From the Shadows, Manabe Shiho's Slap/Humiliate, Drowsy Ichinose Honami's Slumber, etc., except possibly if the character is widely used.

config.json should look like this:
{
    "token": "your Discord authorization token here",
    "ipAddress": "127.0.0.1 if you're using windows, something else if you're using WSL",
    "botID": "1101145170466062416",
    "privateThread": "the id of the private thread you request parties in"
}
